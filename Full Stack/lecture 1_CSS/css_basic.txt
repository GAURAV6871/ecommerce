cascading style sheets at the most basic level indicates 
that the order of css rules matter

Basic CSS selectors
#id
*
element 
element, element
element element 
element > element 
element + element (for eg p element right after h1 element)
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


for using classes we use
.class_name

for using div we use id's for eg we give id name as div1 then for using important
#div1
